**Information architecture:**

Operating within the context of a local Catholic mission, the Sunday school dedicates three out of its four pages to ecclesiastical topics, encompassing news, affiliated churches, and contact details. The dedicated school page features a vibrant background, ample white space, and an enriched visual component. I reorganised the content from the [existing website](http://pmk-neu-ulm.weebly.com/aktualno347ci.html), breaking down extensive text sections into smaller segments to enhance readability and overall clarity.

**Design:**

The design has been predominantly shaped by bootstrap v4, with a focus on optimizing views for tablets and desktops. An eye-catching carousel is featured on the homepage, while a collapse feature has been employed to present other church locations. The images are displayed in a modal overlay with a dimmed background. Gulp has been utilized as a toolkit for task automation.
