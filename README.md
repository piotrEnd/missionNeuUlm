# missionNeuUlm
website for Polish Catholic Mission in Neu-Ulm

My six-years-old son goes to sunday school to keep in touch with mother tongue. So it's a good opportunity to refresh their web appearance. 
For this time I have used:
* Bootstrap 4 as framework
* Gulp as toolkit for automating
* svg-icons, lightbox
