**Information architecture:**

Sunday school operates as part of local catholic mission. For that reason 3 of 4 pages are dedicated to ecclesial issues: news, served churches and contact. School-page has bright background, some whitespace and more graphical content.
I rearranged data from [existing website](http://pmk-neu-ulm.weebly.com/aktualno347ci.html) in new structure. Large text blocks were separated into smaller chunks for overall legibility.

**Design:**

Design is largely shaped by bootstrap v4. Views for tablets and desktops were optimized. Carousel as eye-catcher on homepage. Callapse as solution for displaying other church locations. Lightbox to show images as modals with dimmed background. Gulp used as toolkit for task automation.
